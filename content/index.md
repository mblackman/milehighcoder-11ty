Howdy! I'm Matt Blackman, where technology meets creativity. With a decade of working in different technological landscapes, my journey combines innovation, creativity, and a passion for game development.

## The Path I've Wandered

It all started in a basement, spending hours toiling away at Super Mario Bros. Fast forward through a Computer Science degree from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, and today, my professional saga unfolds at Pocket Gems. In this vibrant crucible, my contributions actively shape the future of mobile gaming.

Within this creative nexus, I craft immersive digital realms and engineering experiences that resonate deeply with a global audience. My tenure at Pocket Gems is marked by hands-on involvement in the game development lifecycle, steering projects from their nascent ideation stages to their final deployment.

## Crafting Digital Experiences

I believe in the magic of software â€” the art of turning code into experiences that enchant and engage. Each project is a new adventure, a new puzzle waiting to be solved. Gaming is a medium that enables us to express ideas entirely outside the reality we live in.

See the things I've worked on and am working on the <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page.

Working with Unity, C#, Godot, and NodeJS, I've developed games and stories that resonate with players.

## Life Beyond the Screen

When the code rests, my world expands. You'll find me in a book, challenging myself on a platformer, taking Polaroid, or on a run. Living near Denver, I'm spoiled with many activities and natural beauty, each offering fresh inspiration and balance.

## A Dream, A Call

My aspiration? To craft digital tales that aren't just played but last in the hearts and minds of my players. If you're on a quest to pioneer unique digital realms and need a like-minded companion, I'm just a message away.
