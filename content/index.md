Howdy! I'm Matt Blackman, a game developer with a passion for turning code into captivating experiences.

My journey started at a young age in a basement, captivated by Super Mario Bros. With a Computer Science degree from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville fueling my drive, I work to build the kinds of games that I love. Here, I collaborate on every stage of the game development process, from initial ideas to the thrill of launch day.

I'm driven by the magic of turning code into captivating adventures. I work with Unity, C#, and Godot to create stories and gameplay that resonate with all kinds of players.

When I'm not coding, I'm reading, tackling platformers, snapping Polaroids, or exploring the natural beauty of Colorado. My dream is to craft games that not only entertain but leave a lasting mark on players.

Let's connect! If you're seeking a collaborator to build amazing digital worlds, drop me a line.
