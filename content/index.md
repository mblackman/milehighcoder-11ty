Howdy! I'm Matt, a game developer passionate about transforming code into unique experiences.

My journey started at a young age in my basement, where I spent countless hours playing Super Mario Bros. This love for gaming led me to pursue a Computer Science degree in college. After graduating, I dedicated many years to working on enterprise software while continuing to indulge my passion for platformers. Games like Mario, Celeste, and Hollow Knight have significantly shaped who I am today, for better or worse.

I am driven by the magic of turning code into experiences that surprise and delight players. I have experience with Unity, C#, and Godot, creating stories and gameplay that resonate with a wide range of players. Recently, I've been working on building my own game engineâ€”an endeavor I believe sets me apart. My goal is to use it to create unique 2D experiences.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, tackling challenging platformers, struggling in Dota 2, and exploring the natural beauty of Colorado. My dream is to craft games that entertain and introduce new ideas that challenge our perceptions of gaming and the world.

As I continue this exciting journey, I'm eager to connect and collaborate with other passionate individuals. I've been somewhat shy about reaching out, but I'm ready to break out of my shell and work on some cool ideas together!
